# RISC-V Project
Extra project done by Bruno Freitas Moreira (me) for the FSC (Fundamentos de Sistemas Computacionais) course. Assembly code in RISC-V for the basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) of two floating point numbers.

# Objective and Conclusions
Objective was to learn more about the architecture of modern computer systems, how the lowest level of programming works and how it is used.
Got more familiar with this level of programming, learned about RISC-V in specific.
